# 🧑‍💻 UserVerse – Flask REST API

> _"In a galaxy of data, every user deserves their own star."_ 🌌

Welcome to **UserVerse** – a simple yet **powerful REST API** built with Python & Flask  
for managing users with style. ✨  
Here, user IDs are **UUID galaxies**, timestamps mark **the birth of stars**,  
and your CRUD operations? 🚀 Interstellar missions.

## 🌟 Features at Warp Speed

- **🆔 Unique UUID IDs** → No boring incremental IDs
- **⏳ Time Travel** → Created/Updated timestamps
- **⚡ CRUD Power** → Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **🛡️ Consistent JSON** → Every response feels familiar
